        Hello! My name is Ezra, and I'm a rising 4th year Computer Science major. 
        I was previously a part of GT Esports, where I was a coordinator and played for GT Valorant during my freshman year, 
        where we were flown out by Red Bull and played at the Georgia World Congress Center. 
        We also ran events such as GT Game Fest, Georgia Tech's BYOC LAN event.

        Some of my hobbies are hanging out with friends, traveling, taking pictures, and going to the gym.

        Something "special" that happened to me last year was that I broke my arm while arm wrestling at my friend's graduation party.
        I've been trying to rehab and build the strength back up since...
